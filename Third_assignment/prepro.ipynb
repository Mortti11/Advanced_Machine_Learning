On one side lay the ocean, and on one Lay a great water, and the moon was full.          Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: \"The sequel of to-day unsolders all The goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we Shall never more, at any future time, Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, Walking about the gardens and the halls Of Camelot, as in the days that were. I perish by this people which I made,— Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again To rule once more—but let what will be, be, I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm That without help I cannot last till morn. Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how In those old days, one summer noon, an arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, Holding the sword—and how I row'd across And took it, and have worn it, like a king: And, wheresoever I am sung or told In aftertime, this also shall be known: But now delay not: take Excalibur, And fling him far into the middle mere: Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word.\"          To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere: \"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus, Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. A little thing may harm a wounded man. Yet I thy hest will all perform at full, Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.\"          So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept And in the moon athwart the place of tombs, Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, Came on the shining levels of the lake.          There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, This way and that dividing the swift mind, In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd There in the many-knotted water-flags, That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. So strode he back slow to the wounded King.          Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: \"Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\"          And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, And the wild water lapping on the crag.\"          To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale: \"Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: For surer sign had follow'd, either hand, Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. This is a shameful thing for men to lie. Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.\"          Then went Sir Bedivere the second time Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought; But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, How curiously and strangely chased, he smote His palms together, and he cried aloud,          \"And if indeed I cast the brand away, Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, Should thus be lost forever from the earth, Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. What good should follow this, if this were done? What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, Seeing obedience is the bond of rule. Were it well to obey then, if a king demand An act unprofitable, against himself? The King is sick, and knows not what he does. What record, or what relic of my lord Should be to aftertime, but empty breath And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, Some one might show it at a joust of arms, Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake; Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases of the hills.' So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people, winning reverence. But now much honour and much fame were lost.\"          So spake he, clouded with his own conceit, And hid Excalibur the second time, And so strode back slow to the wounded King.          Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: \"What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\"          And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"I heard the water lapping on the crag, And the long ripple washing in the reeds.\"          To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: \"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! Authority forgets a dying king, Laid widow'd of the power in his eye That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, In whom should meet the offices of all, Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; Either from lust of gold, or like a girl Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, And the third time may prosper, get thee hence: But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, I will arise and slay thee with my hands.\"          Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, Seen where the moving isles of winter shock By night, with noises of the northern sea. So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere. And lightly went the other to the King.          Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: \"Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?\"          And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, So great a miracle as yonder hilt. Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; But when I look'd again, behold an arm, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere.\"          And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: \"My end draws nigh; 't is time that I were gone. Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, And bear me to the margin; yet I fear My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.\"          So saying, from the pavement he half rose, Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, And would have spoken, but he found not words, Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.          But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King Muttering and murmuring at his ear, \"Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die.\" But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd Larger than human on the frozen hills. He heard the deep behind him, and a cry Before. His own thought drove him like a goad. Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves And barren chasms, and all to left and right The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— And on a sudden, lo! the level lake, And the long glories of the winter moon.          Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, Beneath them; and descending they were ware That all the decks were dense with stately forms Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these Three Queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, And, as it were one voice, an agony Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills All night in a waste land, where no one comes, Or hath come, since the making of the world.          Then murmur'd Arthur, \"Place me in the barge,\" And to the barge they came. There those three Queens Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. But she that rose the tallest of them all And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, And call'd him by his name, complaining loud And dropping bitter tears against his brow Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white And colourless, and like the wither'd moon Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls— That made his forehead like a rising sun High from the daïs-throne—were parch'd with dust; Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. So like a shatter'd column lay the King; Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, From spur to plume a star of tournament, Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.          Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere: \"Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? For now I see the true old times are dead, When every morning brought a noble chance, And every chance brought out a noble knight. Such times have been not since the light that led The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world; And I, the last, go forth companionless, And the days darken round me, and the years, Among new men, strange faces, other minds.\"          And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new, And God fulfils Himself in many ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? I have lived my life, and that which I have done May He within Himself make pure! but thou, If thou shouldst never see my face again, Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day. For what are men better than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain, If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend? For so the whole round earth is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. But now farewell. I am going a long way With these thou seëst—if indeed I go— (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) To the island-valley of Avilion; Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.\"          So said he, and the barge with oar and sail Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere Revolving many memories, till the hull Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, And on the mere the wailing died away.",

         "The Summer Bower",
         "It is a place whither I’ve often goneFor peace, and found it, secret, hushed, and cool, A beautiful recess in neighboring woods. Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall, Arch it o’erhead and column it around, Framing a covert, natural and wild,Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot Unwearied and unweakened. Sound is here A transient and unfrequent visitor;Yet if the day be calm, not often then, Whilst the high pines in one another’s arms Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear Catch the far fall of voices, how remote You know not, and you do not care to know. The turf is soft and green, but not a flower Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and bright—I do not know its name—which here and there Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.A narrow opening in the branched roof,A single one, is large enough to show,With that half-glimpse a dreamer loves so much, The blue air and the blessing of the sky.Thither I always bent my idle steps,When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart, And found the calm I looked for, or returned Strong with the quite rapture in my soul.                                         But one day,One of those July days when winds have fled One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt, Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day, Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once No medicinal virtue.                    Not a leafStirred with the whispering welcome which I sought, But in a close and humid atmosphere,Every fair plant and implicated boughHung lax and lifeless. Something in the place, Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,And some more secret influence, I thought, Weighed on the sense like sin. Above I saw, Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,The palid sky look through a glazed mistLike a blue eye in death.                         The change, perhaps, Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,The weather, and the time explain it all:Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,And shrined it in these verses for my heart. Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought Not less, and in all shades of various moods; But always shun to desecrate the spotBy weak repinings, sickly sentiments,Or inconclusive sorrows. Nature, thoughPure as she was in Eden when her breathKissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,In her own way and with a just reserve, To sympathize with human suffering; But for the pains, the fever, and the fret Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,She hath no solace; and who seeks her when These be the troubles over which he moans, Reads in her unreplying lineaments Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness, Strike like contempt.",

         "so all day long the noise of battle rolld among the mountains by the winter sea until king arthurs table man by man had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord king arthur then because his wound was deep the bold sir bedivere uplifted him sir bedivere the last of all his knights and bore him to a chapel nigh the field a broken chancel with a broken cross that stood on a dark strait of barren land on one side lay the ocean and on one lay a great water and the moon was full          then spake king arthur to sir bedivere the sequel of today unsolders all the goodliest fellowship of famous knights whereof this world holds record such a sleep they sleep—the men i loved i think that we shall never more at any future time delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds walking about the gardens and the halls of camelot as in the days that were i perish by this people which i made— tho merlin sware that i should come again to rule once more—but let what will be be i am so deeply smitten thro the helm that without help i cannot last till morn thou therefore take my brand excalibur which was my pride for thou rememberest how in those old days one summer noon an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake clothed in white samite mystic wonderful holding the sword—and how i rowd across and took it and have worn it like a king and wheresoever i am sung or told in aftertime this also shall be known but now delay not take excalibur and fling him far into the middle mere watch what thou seëst and lightly bring me word          to him replied the bold sir bedivere it is not meet sir king to leave thee thus aidless alone and smitten thro the helm a little thing may harm a wounded man yet i thy hest will all perform at full watch what i see and lightly bring thee word          so saying from the ruind shrine he stept and in the moon athwart the place of tombs where lay the mighty bones of ancient men old knights and over them the seawind sang shrill chill with flakes of foam he stepping down by zigzag paths and juts of pointed rock came on the shining levels of the lake          there drew he forth the brand excalibur and oer him drawing it the winter moon brightening the skirts of a long cloud ran forth and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks myriads of topazlights and jacinth work of subtlest jewellery he gazed so long that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood this way and that dividing the swift mind in act to throw but at the last it seemd better to leave excalibur conceald there in the manyknotted waterflags that whistled stiff and dry about the marge so strode he back slow to the wounded king          then spake king arthur to sir bedivere hast thou performd my mission which i gave what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard          and answer made the bold sir bedivere i heard the ripple washing in the reeds and the wild water lapping on the crag          to whom replied king arthur faint and pale thou hast betrayd thy nature and thy name not rendering true answer as beseemd thy fealty nor like a noble knight for surer sign had followd either hand or voice or else a motion of the mere this is a shameful thing for men to lie yet now i charge thee quickly go again as thou art lief and dear and do the thing i bade thee watch and lightly bring me word          then went sir bedivere the second time across the ridge and paced beside the mere counting the dewy pebbles fixed in thought but when he saw the wonder of the hilt how curiously and strangely chased he smote his palms together and he cried aloud          and if indeed i cast the brand away surely a precious thing one worthy note should thus be lost forever from the earth which might have pleased the eyes of many men what good should follow this if this were done what harm undone deep harm to disobey seeing obedience is the bond of rule were it well to obey then if a king demand an act unprofitable against himself the king is sick and knows not what he does what record or what relic of my lord should be to aftertime but empty breath and rumours of a doubt but were this kept stored in some treasurehouse of mighty kings some one might show it at a joust of arms saying king arthurs sword excalibur wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills so might some old man speak in the aftertime to all the people winning reverence but now much honour and much fame were lost          so spake he clouded with his own conceit and hid excalibur the second time and so strode back slow to the wounded king          then spoke king arthur breathing heavily what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard          and answer made the bold sir bedivere i heard the water lapping on the crag and the long ripple washing in the reeds          to whom replied king arthur much in wrath ah miserable and unkind untrue unknightly traitorhearted woe is me authority forgets a dying king laid widowd of the power in his eye that bowd the will i see thee what thou art for thou the latestleft of all my knights in whom should meet the offices of all thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt either from lust of gold or like a girl valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes yet for a man may fail in duty twice and the third time may prosper get thee hence but if thou spare to fling excalibur i will arise and slay thee with my hands          then quickly rose sir bedivere and ran and leaping down the ridges lightly plunged among the bulrushbeds and clutchd the sword and strongly wheeld and threw it the great brand made lightnings in the splendour of the moon and flashing round and round and whirld in an arch shot like a streamer of the northern morn seen where the moving isles of winter shock by night with noises of the northern sea so flashd and fell the brand excalibur but ere he dipt the surface rose an arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful and caught him by the hilt and brandishd him three times and drew him under in the mere and lightly went the other to the king          then spoke king arthur drawing thicker breath now see i by thine eyes that this is done speak out what is it thou hast heard or seen          and answer made the bold sir bedivere sir king i closed mine eyelids lest the gems should blind my purpose for i never saw nor shall see here or elsewhere till i die not tho i live three lives of mortal men so great a miracle as yonder hilt then with both hands i flung him wheeling him but when i lookd again behold an arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful that caught him by the hilt and brandishd him three times and drew him under in the mere          and answer made king arthur breathing hard my end draws nigh t is time that i were gone make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight and bear me to the margin yet i fear my wound hath taken cold and i shall die          so saying from the pavement he half rose slowly with pain reclining on his arm and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture him sir bedivere remorsefully regarded thro his tears and would have spoken but he found not words then took with care and kneeling on one knee oer both his shoulders drew the languid hands and rising bore him thro the place of tombs          but as he walkd king arthur panted hard like one that feels a nightmare on his bed when all the house is mute so sighd the king muttering and murmuring at his ear quick quick i fear it is too late and i shall die but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge clothed with his breath and looking as he walkd larger than human on the frozen hills he heard the deep behind him and a cry before his own thought drove him like a goad dry clashd his harness in the icy caves and barren chasms and all to left and right the bare black cliff clangd round him as he based his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang sharpsmitten with the dint of armed heels— and on a sudden lo the level lake and the long glories of the winter moon          then saw they how there hove a dusky barge dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern beneath them and descending they were ware that all the decks were dense with stately forms blackstoled blackhooded like a dream—by these three queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose a cry that shiverd to the tingling stars and as it were one voice an agony of lamentation like a wind that shrills all night in a waste land where no one comes or hath come since the making of the world          then murmurd arthur place me in the barge and to the barge they came there those three queens put forth their hands and took the king and wept but she that rose the tallest of them all and fairest laid his head upon her lap and loosed the shatterd casque and chafed his hands and calld him by his name complaining loud and dropping bitter tears against his brow striped with dark blood for all his face was white and colourless and like the witherd moon smote by the fresh beam of the springing east and all his greaves and cuisses dashd with drops of onset and the light and lustrous curls— that made his forehead like a rising sun high from the daïsthrone—were parchd with dust or clotted into points and hanging loose mixd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips so like a shatterd column lay the king not like that arthur who with lance in rest from spur to plume a star of tournament shot thro the lists at camelot and charged before the eyes of ladies and of kings          then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere ah my lord arthur whither shall i go where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes for now i see the true old times are dead when every morning brought a noble chance and every chance brought out a noble knight such times have been not since the light that led the holy elders with the gift of myrrh but now the whole round table is dissolved which was an image of the mighty world and i the last go forth companionless and the days darken round me and the years among new men strange faces other minds          and slowly answerd arthur from the barge the old order changeth yielding place to new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world comfort thyself what comfort is in me i have lived my life and that which i have done may he within himself make pure but thou if thou shouldst never see my face again pray for my soul more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of wherefore let thy voice rise like a fountain for me night and day for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend for so the whole round earth is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of god but now farewell i am going a long way with these thou seëst—if indeed i go— for all my mind is clouded with a doubt to the islandvalley of avilion where falls not hail or rain or any snow nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies deepmeadowd happy fair with orchardlawns and bowery hollows crownd with summer sea where i will heal me of my grievous wound          so said he and the barge with oar and sail moved from the brink like some fullbreasted swan that fluting a wild carol ere her death ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood with swarthy webs long stood sir bedivere revolving many memories till the hull lookd one black dot against the verge of dawn and on the mere the wailing died away",
